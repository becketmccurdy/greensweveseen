# Greensweveseen1 Engineering & UX/UI Action Plan

## Immediate Fixes for Broken Features

### 1. Save Round
- **Bug Diagnosis**
  - Check if the round data is being correctly written to Supabase/Prisma.
  - Ensure "Save" button triggers the correct mutation and provides user feedback (loading, success, error).
  - Validate input before save; display errors if round data incomplete.
- **Engineering Tasks**
  - Audit API routes/server actions for writing round data.
  - Add optimistic UI update for save action.
  - Improve error messages on save failure.

### 2. Friends System
- **Bug Diagnosis**
  - Verify friend request flow (send/accept/decline) is connected to backend.
  - Ensure UI updates reflect friend status changes in real time.
- **Engineering Tasks**
  - Complete missing server actions for friend requests and acceptance.
  - Add notification or activity feed for friend actions.
  - Improve UI feedback (pending requests, accepted, rejected).
  - Add optimistic updates for friend actions.

### 3. Settings
- **Bug Diagnosis**
  - Confirm settings are read from and written to the correct location in the database.
  - Check settings save triggers and error handling.
- **Engineering Tasks**
  - Audit the settings form: field validation, default values, save action.
  - Add loading and error states to settings UI.
  - Ensure changes persist and reflect immediately.

### 4. Statistics Dashboard
- **Bug Diagnosis**
  - Review queries, data aggregation, and chart rendering.
  - Check for missing or malformed data.
- **Engineering Tasks**
  - Build/fix API endpoints to aggregate statistics (scores, trends, etc.).
  - Add fallback UI for empty or loading states.
  - Implement error handling for failed stat loads.
  - Use charting library (e.g., [Recharts](https://recharts.org/), [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/)) for visualizations.

## General UX/UI Improvements

- **Feedback & Loading States:** Add clear loading spinners and success/error feedback for all async actions.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Audit all components for mobile responsiveness. Use gesture controls for score entry where possible.
- **Accessibility:** Test with screen readers. Ensure color contrast and keyboard navigation for all user flows.
- **Notifications:** Use toast/snackbar for quick feedback (saving, friend requests, errors).
- **Consistent Design:** Harmonize UI elements using shadcn/ui or custom design system.

## Actionable Next Steps (Copy/Paste into Windsurf)

### Component Development
- Use Windsurf AI to scaffold/fix these components:
  - **Scorecard:** Hole-by-hole entry, live score computation, par comparison.
  - **Statistics Dashboard:** Score trends, handicap progression, performance metrics.
  - **Friends List & Activity Feed:** Requests, acceptance, leaderboard, sharing.
  - **Settings:** Profile/data settings with validation, persistence.
  - **Course Discovery:** Search, ratings, favorites, recommendations.

### API & Schema
- Use Windsurf to:
  - Generate/fix Prisma schema for rounds, friends, statistics, settings.
  - Write server actions for save round, friend requests, stats aggregation.
  - Add Zod validation for all mutations.
  - Update RLS policies for new features.

### Testing
- Add unit tests for each core function (saving rounds, friend request, stats calculations).
- Write E2E tests for end-to-end user flows (score round, add friend, change settings, view stats).

### Performance
- Implement data caching for stats and round history.
- Use lazy loading for images and charts.
- Optimize image uploads and gallery view.

### Monitoring
- Set up Sentry for error logging.
- Add analytics for user actions (save, add friend, settings change).

---

## Deployment & Workflow
- Configure Vercel for previews and production.
- Use environment variables for Supabase/Prisma securely.
- Set up monitoring and analytics for live feedback.

**Tip:** For each broken feature, start by writing a Windsurf prompt like:
> "Generate/fix the React component and backend logic for [feature]. Use Prisma and Supabase. Add UI feedback and error handling."
